    Create own ArrayList
  </summary>
<div style="font-size:17px">
The purpose of the task is to study in detail the device of the ArrayList class. 
During execution the following methods were implemented:

- add(int index, E element)
- addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
- clear()
- get(int index)
- isEmpty()
- remove(int index)
- remove(Object o)
- sort(Comparator<? super E> c)

The sorting method was implemented by the quicksort algorithm with partitioning from the center.
The implementation of the methods is presented in a simplified form, since we are not chasing exact copying, but are trying to understand the essence of the methods and understand how they work.<hr>
